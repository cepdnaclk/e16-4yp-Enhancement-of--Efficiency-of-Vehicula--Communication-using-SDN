## Abstract
This research article explores software-defined networking (SDN) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), which are networks formed by vehicles communicating with each other. Mobility is a key factor that can impact network performance in VANET, and traditional network architectures can struggle to handle the frequent changes in network topology caused by vehicle movement.
The study focuses on using the reactive routing protocol Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) in an SDN architecture for VANET. The performance of this setup was analyzed based on essential quality of service (QoS) metrics, including packet delay and transfer rate. The results of the study showed that the highest packet delay in VANET using SDN was lower than that of traditional network architectures, and the packet transfer rate was higher.
The use of SDN in VANET enables a more adaptable and dynamic network architecture that can respond quickly to changes in network conditions caused by vehicle mobility. By separating the control plane from the data plane, SDN enables centralized management of the network, making it easier to adjust network configurations to accommodate changes in network topology dynamically. This research suggests that SDN can be an effective solution for improving network performance in mobile environments such as VANET and that the use of reactive routing protocols like AODV can further enhance this performance.
