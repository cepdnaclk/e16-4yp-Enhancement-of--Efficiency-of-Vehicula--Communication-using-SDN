# Enhancement of the Efficiency of Vehicular Communication using SDN
___
#### Aim of the proposed project:
Vehicular communications networks (VCNs) are created by vehicles equipped with short and
medium-range wireless communication technologies. It includes vehicular ad-hoc networks
(VANETs). At present cars and other private vehicles are widely used by people. The biggest
challenge that they are facing. Researchers are trying to resolve these problems by introducing
vehicular networks. This communication can reduce the number of vehicle accidents that
happens on the road. VCNs pose some requirements to operate in reality. It is a wireless ad hoc
network it needs mobility to make sure the connections are made seamless. Also, they need to
be with less latency because the information that is communicated is time reliant. And this
network faces frequent disconnections the network should be able to handle these challenges
to work in a real-world application. To overcome these problems, research communities have
a significant interest to apply OpenFlow in wireless ad hoc networks. One of the major drivers
of OpenFlow is its simplification. It simplifies networks by allowing them to decouple complex
software from nodes and deploying it in external servers called controllers. By introducing
Software Defined Networking (SDN) into VCNs the efficiency of the VCNs is increased and
it becomes more of a real-world application.
